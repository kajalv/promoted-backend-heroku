Data is transforming business, social interactions, and the future of our society. In this course, you will learn how to use data and analytics to give an edge to your career and your life. We will examine real world examples of how analytics have been used to significantly improve a business or industry. These examples include Moneyball, eHarmony, the Framingham Heart Study, Twitter, IBM Watson, and Netflix. Through these examples and many more, we will teach you the following analytics methods: linear regression, logistic regression, trees, text analytics, clustering, visualization, and optimization. We will be using the statistical software R to build models and work with data. The contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class (The Analytics Edge). It is a challenging class, but it will enable you to apply analytics to real-world applications.</p>\r\n<p>The class will consist of lecture videos, which are broken into small pieces, usually between 4 and 8 minutes each. After each lecture piece, we will ask you a &ldquo;quick question&rdquo; to assess your understanding of the material. There will also be a recitation, in which one of the teaching assistants will go over the methods introduced with a new example and data set. Each week will have a homework assignment that involves working in R or LibreOffice with various data sets. (R is a free statistical and computing software environment we&rsquo;ll use in the course. See the Software FAQ below for more info). At the end of the class there will be a final exam, which will be similar to the homework assignments.</p>",

Data is transforming business, social interactions, and the future of our society. In this course, you will learn how to use data and analytics to give an edge to your career and your life. We will examine real world examples of how analytics have been used to significantly improve a business or industry. These examples include Moneyball, eHarmony, the Framingham Heart Study, Twitter, IBM Watson, and Netflix. Through these examples and many more, we will teach you the following analytics methods: linear regression, logistic regression, trees, text analytics, clustering, visualization, and optimization. We will be using the statistical software R to build models and work with data. The contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class (The Analytics Edge). It is a challenging class, but it will enable you to apply analytics to real-world applications.</p>\r\n<p>The class will consist of lecture videos, which are broken into small pieces, usually between 4 and 8 minutes each. After each lecture piece, we will ask you a &ldquo;quick question&rdquo; to assess your understanding of the material. There will also be a recitation, in which one of the teaching assistants will go over the methods introduced with a new example and data set. Each week will have a homework assignment that involves working in R or LibreOffice with various data sets. (R is a free statistical and computing software environment we&rsquo;ll use in the course. See the Software FAQ below for more info). At the end of the class there will be a final exam, which will be similar to the homework assignments.</p>",

      "faq": "What do I need to know about the topic prior to enrolling in the course?<br /><br />You only need to know basic mathematics. For most people, this is equivalent to basic high school mathematics. You should know concepts like mean, standard deviation, and histograms. This course is also useful for those who already have experience in the subject. In each lecture, recitation, and homework assignment, we use a different dataset and case to illustrate the method. Even if you are familiar with all of the methods taught, you can still learn a lot from the different examples.<br /><br />What software will be used in the course?<br /><br />We&rsquo;ll be using two software programs in this class: R and LibreOffice. Both are free online, and you don&rsquo;t need to be familiar with either of them to take the course. R is a free statistical and computing software environment and LibreOffice is similar to MS Office but a free open source program. Specifically we&rsquo;ll use the LibreOffice module, Calc in this course. Don&rsquo;t worry though - we&rsquo;ll teach everything from scratch!",

Are you interested in what you can do to build a better work for yourself and the next generation? If we take the right actions, we can shape the future of work in ways that meet the needs of workers, families, and their economies and societies. To do so, we first have to understand how work is changing, how firms can prosper and support good jobs and careers, and how to update the policies, institutions, and practices governing the world of work. The goal of this course is to understand the relationship between new technologies, work and society and develop plans of action for improving the job and career opportunities for today and tomorrow's workforce. </p>\n<p>We'll start by looking at the challenges we face today and in the near future in regards to globalization and technology change, as well as the unique opportunities that they present. Then we will take a deep dive into the history of work and employment to understand how the it affects us today, as well as to look at solutions that worked well in response to similar problems. We'll look at the impact advances in technology are having across industries, and the ways in which these technologies are transforming the nature of human work and skills needed. We will explore ways in which we as a society can and should shape and catalyze these new technologies to complement and augment human work, rather than replace it. We'll also take you on a personal journey, where you will learn what employers expect in today's world of work--the skills, flexibility, and knowledge that are crucial for success in the contemporary workplace. We'll examine what has to happen in order for employers, workers, governments, and educators to come together to forge new policies, rules, and understandings for governing the world of work in the 21st century, and together as a class forge a <strong>new social contract of work</strong> as well as a personal action plan to implement it. </p>\n<p>Many colleagues and groups around the world share our deep concern for these issues and are studying how to address them in their specific settings. We invite each of you to join us and to share your insights and ideas about how we can make work, work better for all in the years ahead. In this spirit we will draw on our own expert group here--ourMIT Task Force on Work of the Future. Together we can make a difference for the next generation workforce, our economies, and our societies.</p>",

Are you interested in what you can do to build a better work for yourself and the next generation? If we take the right actions, we can shape the future of work in ways that meet the needs of workers, families, and their economies and societies. To do so, we first have to understand how work is changing, how firms can prosper and support good jobs and careers, and how to update the policies, institutions, and practices governing the world of work. The goal of this course is to understand the relationship between new technologies, work and society and develop plans of action for improving the job and career opportunities for today and tomorrow's workforce. </p>\n<p>We'll start by looking at the challenges we face today and in the near future in regards to globalization and technology change, as well as the unique opportunities that they present. Then we will take a deep dive into the history of work and employment to understand how the it affects us today, as well as to look at solutions that worked well in response to similar problems. We'll look at the impact advances in technology are having across industries, and the ways in which these technologies are transforming the nature of human work and skills needed. We will explore ways in which we as a society can and should shape and catalyze these new technologies to complement and augment human work, rather than replace it. We'll also take you on a personal journey, where you will learn what employers expect in today's world of work--the skills, flexibility, and knowledge that are crucial for success in the contemporary workplace. We'll examine what has to happen in order for employers, workers, governments, and educators to come together to forge new policies, rules, and understandings for governing the world of work in the 21st century, and together as a class forge a <strong>new social contract of work</strong> as well as a personal action plan to implement it. </p>\n<p>Many colleagues and groups around the world share our deep concern for these issues and are studying how to address them in their specific settings. We invite each of you to join us and to share your insights and ideas about how we can make work, work better for all in the years ahead. In this spirit we will draw on our own expert group here--ourMIT Task Force on Work of the Future. Together we can make a difference for the next generation workforce, our economies, and our societies.</p>",

Can you find a shape that has finite volume, but infinite surface area? How does the weight of the rider change the trajectory of a zip line ride? These and many other questions can be answered by harnessing the power of the integral.</p>\r\n<p>But what is an integral? You will learn to interpret it geometrically as an area under a graph, and discover its connection to the derivative. You will encounter functions that you cannot integrate without a computer and develop a big bag of tricks to attack the functions that you can integrate by hand. The integral is vital in engineering design, scientific analysis, probability and statistics. You will use integrals to find centers of mass, the stress on a beam during construction, the power exerted by a motor, and the distance traveled by a rocket.<br /><br />The three modules in this series are being offered as an XSeries on edX.

Can you find a shape that has finite volume, but infinite surface area? How does the weight of the rider change the trajectory of a zip line ride? These and many other questions can be answered by harnessing the power of the integral.</p>\r\n<p>But what is an integral? You will learn to interpret it geometrically as an area under a graph, and discover its connection to the derivative. You will encounter functions that you cannot integrate without a computer and develop a big bag of tricks to attack the functions that you can integrate by hand. The integral is vital in engineering design, scientific analysis, probability and statistics. You will use integrals to find centers of mass, the stress on a beam during construction, the power exerted by a motor, and the distance traveled by a rocket.<br /><br />The three modules in this series are being offered as an XSeries on edX.

At the continuum level, we learn how forces and displacements translate into stress and strain distributions within the material. At the atomistic level, we learn the mechanisms that control the mechanical properties of materials. Examples are drawn from metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, biomaterials, composites and cellular materials.</p>\r\n<p>Part 1 covers stress-strain behavior, topics in linear elasticity and the atomic basis for linear elasticity, and composite materials.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/mechanical-behavior-materials-part-2-mitx-3-032-2x\">Part 2</a> covers stress transformations, beam bending, column buckling, and cellular materials.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/mechanical-behavior-materials-part-3-mitx-3-032-3x\">Part 3</a> covers viscoelasticity (behavior intermediate to that of an elastic solid and that of a viscous fluid), plasticity (permanent deformation), creep in crystalline materials (time dependent behavior), brittle fracture (rapid crack propagation) and fatigue (failure due to repeated loading of a material).</p>",

This course is the third of three in a series of mechanics courses from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT. Taken together, these courses provide similar content to the MIT subject 3.032: Mechanical Behavior of Materials.</p>\r\n<p>The 3.032x series provides an introduction to the mechanical behavior of materials, from both the continuum and atomistic points of view. At the continuum level, we learn how forces and displacements translate into stress and strain distributions within the material. At the atomistic level, we learn the mechanisms that control the mechanical properties of materials. Examples are drawn from metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, biomaterials, composites and cellular materials.</p>\r\n<p>Part 3 covers viscoelasticity (behavior intermediate to that of an elastic solid and that of a viscous fluid), plasticity (permanent deformation), creep in crystalline materials (time dependent behavior), brittle fracture (rapid crack propagation) and fatigue (failure due to repeated loading of a material).</p>",
